# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all
operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, including labels.
- **List issues**: use `gh issue list` with appropriate state and label filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or
  `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside
the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

GitHub shares one number space across issues and pull requests. Resolve an
ambiguous reference with `gh pr view <number>` and fall back to
`gh issue view <number>`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Blocking relationships

Use GitHub's native issue dependencies when available. If dependencies are
unavailable, add a `Blocked by: #<number>` entry to the dependent issue's body.

A ticket is unblocked when every blocking issue is closed.
